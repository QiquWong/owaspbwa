#
# -=[ Mode of Operation ]=-
#
# You can now choose how you want to run the modsecurity rules -
#
#       Anomaly Scoring vs. Traditional
#
# Each detection rule uses the "block" action which will inherit the SecDefaultAction
# specified below.  Your settings here will determine which mode of operation you use.
#
# Traditional mode is the current default setting and it uses "deny" (you can set any
# disruptive action you wish)
#
# If you want to run the rules in Anomaly Scoring mode (where blocking is delayed until the
# end of the request phase and rules contribute to an anomaly score) then set the 
# SecDefaultAction to "pass"
#
# You can also decide how you want to handle logging actions.  You have three options -
#
#       - To log to both the Apache error_log and ModSecurity audit_log file use - log
#       - To log *only* to the ModSecurity audit_log file use - nolog,auditlog
#       - To log *only* to the Apache error_log file use - log,noauditlog
#
SecDefaultAction "phase:2,deny,log"


# 
# -=[ Anomaly Scoring Block Mode ]=-
# 
# This is a collaborative detection mode where each rule will increment an overall
# anomaly score the transaction. The scores are then evaluated in the following files:
#
# Inbound anomaly score - checked in the modsecurity_crs_49_inbound_blocking.conf file
# Outbound anomaly score - checked in the modsecurity_crs_59_outbound_blocking.conf file
#
# If you do not want to use anomaly scoring mode, then comment out this line.
#
#SecAction "phase:1,t:none,nolog,pass,setvar:tx.anomaly_score_blocking=on"


#
# -=[ Anomaly Scoring Severity Levels ]=-
#
# These are the default scoring points for each severity level.  You may
# adjust these to you liking.  These settings will be used in macro expansion
# in the rules to increment the anomaly scores when rules match.
#
# These are the default Severity ratings (with anomaly scores) of the individual rules -
#
#    - 2: Critical - Anomaly Score of 5.
#         Is the highest severity level possible without correlation.  It is
#         normally generated by the web attack rules (40 level files).
#    - 3: Error - Anomaly Score of 4.
#         Is generated mostly from outbound leakage rules (50 level files).
#    - 4: Warning - Anomaly Score of 3.
#         Is generated by malicious client rules (35 level files).
#    - 5: Notice - Anomaly Score of 2.
#         Is generated by the Protocol policy and anomaly files.

#
# You should set the score to the proper threshold you would prefer. If set to "5"
# it will work similarly to previous Mod CRS rules and will create an event in the error_log
# file if there are any rules that match.  If you would like to lessen the number of events
# generated in the error_log file, you should increase the anomaly score threshold to
# something like "20".  This would only generate an event in the error_log file if
# there are multiple lower severity rule matches or if any 1 higher severity item matches.

# -=[ Paranoid Mode ]=-
#
# There are many different transactional variables that can be inspected for
# attacks.  Some variables, such as ARGS, has the best false negative/false
# positive ratio where it will catch the vast majority of attack payloads and
# not have a high false positive rate.  This is also true for some security
# checks such as @validateByteRange checks where we are initially only inspecting
# for Nul Bytes.
#
# There are, however, some possibilities for false negative issues with inspecting
# parsed data and this could lead to missed attacks.  If you
# want to lessen the chances for false negatives, then you should enable 
# "Paranoid Mode" processing by setting the following line to 1.  This will process
# additional rules that are inspecting variables with a higher false positive rate.
