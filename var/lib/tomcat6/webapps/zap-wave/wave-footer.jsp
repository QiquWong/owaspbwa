The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy - Web Application Vulnerability Examples (WAVE) are a set of pages which exhibit known vulnerabilities.
<p>
The vulnerabilities included are only those that can (or should be) detectable via automated scanners. <br/>
They have been developed to test OWASP ZAP but can be used for any other legitimate purpose.
<p>
Each page should contain only one vulnerability, and should be as simple as possible an example.<br/>
Only essential links should be included so that automated spidering can be constrained as easily as possible.
