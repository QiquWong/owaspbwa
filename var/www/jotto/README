A lot like vicnum only based on the computer coming up with a word, not a number. Different encoding options as well.
Set up is similiar to vicnum , only the database is called jotto and the guess is char(5). And of  course you need to customize apache to make the scripts work and directories indexable ... 

Much more related verbage in the vicnum manual.
